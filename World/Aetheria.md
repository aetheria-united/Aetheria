The world of Aetheria is one of struggle and chaos. the time that we are entering into is the loss of the Golden age in decay. The world was once ruled by a group of noble servants of [Raythelion](../World/Religion/Raythelion.md) and over time the corruption of [Erabose](../World/Religion/Erabose.md) brought the once Golden civilization to it's knees. The greater world still thinks that it is worshiping Raythellion, but their practices reflect more about what [Erabose](../World/Religion/Erabose.md) would want. Bringing Death and Destruction rather than growth and peace even sacrificing their children on alters to [Raythelion](../World/Religion/Raythelion.md), which is an abomination to him.
