## **Prayer to Shananooah, The Time Weaver**

O Shananooah, divine weaver of moments,
Your celestial orbit binds the threads of fate.
In your infinite hourglass, sands of eternity flow,
Marking the pulse of the cosmos in silent grace.

Guide us, Chronolites, through the temporal maze,
Where past and future in your presence unite.
Teach us to cherish each fleeting second,
For in your realm, every instant is alight.

Bless us with foresight, clarity, and vision,
To see beyond the veil of time's mystic shroud.
May we embrace change, the seed of the morrow,
And in your chronicles, may our deeds be proud.

In the Ceremony of Moments, we reflect and foresee,
Honoring the tapestry you so artfully weave.
Through the Hourglass Turn, we seek inner peace,
In the eternal cycle, we believe and conceive.

Shananooah, Goddess of Time, Continuity, and Fate,
We are but stardust in your grand cosmic tale.
With reverence, we walk the path you illuminate,
As Chronolites, in your brilliance, we shall prevail.
