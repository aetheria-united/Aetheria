In awe of your boundless light.

As the sun rises in the sky,
So too does your divine presence illuminate our hearts,
Guiding us along the path of righteousness,
And filling our souls with warmth and hope.

We thank you for the gift of life,
For the bountiful harvests and the fertile earth,

Courage to face the trials ahead,
And wisdom to discern the path of righteousness,
So that we may walk in your light and spread your divine love.

And shield us from the shadows that threaten to engulf us,
For you are our guardian and our protector,
Watching over us with unwavering vigilance.
