# **The Dark Pantheon**
Led by the fallen deity Erabose, this pantheon stands in opposition to Raythelion's will, sowing discord and strife.

- **[Erabose](../Erabose.md)**: Once a member of the Luminous Authority, Erabose rebelled for reasons unknown. Now, as the sovereign of shadows, he and his dark pantheon plot against the forces of light.
