## Prayer to Erabose, the Sovereign of Shadows

Oh Erabose, Dark Sovereign,
Master of shadows and harbinger of chaos,
We kneel before your boundless power,
In reverence and awe of your dark majesty.

Grant us strength in the shadows,
And cunning to outwit our foes,
Fill our hearts with ambition,
And guide our steps towards dominion.

In the depths of darkness, we find solace,
In the whispers of shadows, we hear your voice,
Lead us through the night,
And empower us to conquer the light.

We offer our allegiance to you, oh Erabose,
Our hearts are yours, our souls your vessel,
May your darkness cloak us,
And your power sustain us through the night.

In your name, we pledge our loyalty,
And vow to spread chaos and despair,
Across the realms, in your honor,
Until darkness reigns supreme forevermore.

Hail Erabose, Sovereign of Shadows,
May your darkness eclipse the light,
And your reign be eternal.
