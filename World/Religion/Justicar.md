## Prayer to Justicar, the Guardian of Balance

Oh, Justicar, Scalebearer divine,
Whose gavel strikes with justice's sign,
In your presence, we stand aligned,
Seeking righteousness, our hearts refined.

Grant us wisdom, in judgment's hour,
To weigh the truth with impartial power,
Let fairness reign in every tower,
And justice bloom like a sacred flower.

Guide our hands, in the pursuit of right,
Against the darkness, our beacon bright,
With scales of balance, clear our sight,
And banish corruption from our sight.

Justicar, guardian of morality's decree,
In your name, we bend the knee,
With steadfast hearts, we pledge to thee,
To uphold justice, eternally.

Amen.
