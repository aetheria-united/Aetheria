# Radiant
A radiant is a person who was chosen by Raythelion to be his representation on the earth. They are very rare and only appear in times of great need and upheaval. They are reincarnations of the Hero's of old. it is unknown if they are born into their reincarnation or chosen as someone who has a suitable attitude and disposition of the hero. It is generally believed that the essence of the previous Radiants lives along side the current incarnation, guiding and helping them, but not possessing them. Once a Radiant is chosen, that person can never be unchosen no matter what they do. In current day, Radiants are viewed to be evil menaces that seek to corrupt society based on some of the more recent incarnations that are known, so a young Radiant needs to be careful to not reveal themselves to the people that they don't know well or even to some people that they do know well or they will be chased out of town at best or murdered at worse. being a Radiant is walking on a knives edge.
