# Radiant
In the realm shaped by the divine Raythelion, a Radiant is an individual marked by destiny to embody the celestial will on Earth. These enigmatic beings emerge only during epochs of dire crisis, serving as the reincarnated champions of lore. The method of their selection remains a mystery—whether they are born anew with the soul of a past hero or chosen for their kindred spirit. It is widely held that the spirits of former Radiants dwell within their successors, offering counsel and support without seizing control. Once anointed by Raythelion’s light, a Radiant’s fate is irrevocably sealed, their path unalterable by any deed.

In the present age, however, Radiants are feared as harbingers of ruin, their intentions mistrusted due to the infamy of recent bearers whose very names—Maldran the Deceiver, Syrith the Shadowed, and Vorath the Betrayer—evoke terror in the common folk. This grim legacy compels the nascent Radiant to tread with utmost caution, concealing their true nature from all but the most trusted confidants, lest they face societal exile or, worse, the relentless pursuit of their demise. Two venerable orders of knights, the Order of the Dawnguard and the Sentinels of Equilibrium, have arisen to purge this perceived threat. For a Radiant, existence is akin to balancing upon the razor’s edge.

## Game Statistics 
### **Sign of the Sun**
The character calls upon their connection with Raythelion, igniting an inner sun. Their skin begins to glow like a lampshade, and an aura resembling flickering flames moves up and down their body. This aura eventually takes the shape of an animal that represents their inner self, a unique trait that unmistakably identifies them as a Radiant.

Activating this ability takes one action and causes the character to shed light in a 20-foot radius for 10 minutes. This effect cannot be removed or dispelled before the time limit ends. While this ability is active, the character gains resistance to spirit damage equal to half their level, rounded down.

When a Radiant uses an innate spell granted by their Radiant Nature or a Sun's Blessing ability, a lesser version of this phenomenon occurs. They glow faintly, and a silhouette of their aura appears. Although this glow is not bright enough to read by, it unmistakably marks them as a Radiant. As they use more abilities, the aura's intensity increases, making battles involving Radiants a spectacular sight.

### **Brilliant Toughness**
Radiants are tougher than a typical creature of their class and heritage. Radiants increase their max HP by 3 for each level they possess.

### **Enlightened Skills**
Radiants catch on to abilities quicker than your average person. Every time your class would grant you a skill feat, you get +1 Skill Feat. (If you are a Rogue this is every level, if you are anything else, it is every even level)

### **Innate Spells** *(Mystic Armor, Radiant Beam and Sunburst)*
A Radiant can channel the power of Raythelion, gaining access to cleric spells granted by Raythelion. They can use these spells once per day as innate abilities. These innate spells are automatically heightened based on the Radiant's level and the corresponding spell rank, even if the character is not a spellcaster.

### **Ancestry Paragon**
All Radiants automatically have the ***Ancestral Paragon Variant Rule*** Applied

### **Sun's Blessing**
Radiants possess unique supernatural powers that grow stronger over time and become signature abilities for each individual. At 1st level, the character can choose one Deviant Ability Feat and adapt it to fit a sun theme. This ability will become even more powerful at 4th & 10th level.
