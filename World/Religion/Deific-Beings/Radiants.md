# Radiant
In the realm shaped by the divine Raythelion, a Radiant is an individual marked by destiny to embody the celestial will on Earth. These enigmatic beings emerge only during epochs of dire crisis, serving as the reincarnated champions of lore. The method of their selection remains a mystery—whether they are born anew with the soul of a past hero or chosen for their kindred spirit. It is widely held that the spirits of former Radiants dwell within their successors, offering counsel and support without seizing control. Once anointed by Raythelion’s light, a Radiant’s fate is irrevocably sealed, their path unalterable by any deed.

In the present age, however, Radiants are feared as harbingers of ruin, their intentions mistrusted due to the infamy of recent bearers whose very names—Maldran the Deceiver, Syrith the Shadowed, and Vorath the Betrayer—evoke terror in the common folk. This grim legacy compels the nascent Radiant to tread with utmost caution, concealing their true nature from all but the most trusted confidants, lest they face societal exile or, worse, the relentless pursuit of their demise. Two venerable orders of knights, the Order of the Dawnguard and the Sentinels of Equilibrium, have arisen to purge this perceived threat. For a Radiant, existence is akin to balancing upon the razor’s edge.
