## Backstory
# Karsten Kendrick: Champion

Karsten Kendrick was prophesied to be a mouthpiece for [Raythelion](../../World/Religion/Raythelion.md) before he was born. His parents were devout believers in the ways of [Raythelion](../../World/Religion/Raythelion.md), viewing guiding and serving the people of [Solaris](../../World/Locations/Solaris.md) as the ultimate devotion to their god. However, one night at a worship vigil, they were asked to give their firstborn up to the religious leaders. Torn between their devotion to the faith and their love for their son, they ultimately trusted the prophets of [Raythelion](../../World/Religion/Raythelion.md) with their greatest treasure.

Karsten was prophesied to bring back peace and restoration to the continent of [Solaris](../../World/Locations/Solaris.md) from immense devastation. Placed in a paladin sect of [the Order of the Blessed Realm](../../World/Factions/Order-of-the-Blessed-Realm.md), known as the [Solaris Sentinels](Solaris-Sentinels.md) he became a part of a secret sect of highly trained, devoted, and disciplined champions for the protection of the order and community against evil.

Protected by the prayers of his family and his god, Karsten moved north to avoid [The Flaming Retribution](../../World/Events/The-Flaming-Retribution.md), a devastating disaster that struck [the Blessed Realm](../../World/Locations/Solaris/Old-World/The-Blessed-Realm/0-The-Blessed-Realm) and left it in ruin. He remained uncertain of what lay ahead for his land and order.
