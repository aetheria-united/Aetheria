## Background

Karsten Kendrick was prophesied to be a redeemer of [Raythelion](../../World/Religion/Raythelion.md) before he was born. His parents were devout believers in the ways of [Raythelion](../../World/Religion/Raythelion.md), holding that guiding and serving the people of [Solaris](../../World/Locations/Solaris.md) was the ultimate devotion to their god. Their faith was tested when, during a workshop vigil, they were asked to give their firstborn to the religious leaders. Torn between their devotion and their love for Karsten, they ultimately trusted the prophets of [Raythelion](../../World/Religion/Raythelion.md) with their greatest treasure.

Karsten's destiny was foretold to bring peace and restoration to the continent of [Solaris](../../World/Locations/Solaris.md) after immense devastation. The Order of [The Blessed Realm](../../World/Locations/Solaris/Old-World/The-Blessed-Realm/0-The-Blessed-Realm.md) recognized his potential but could not prevent the impending doom. The order was infiltrated by philosophies that turned many devout leaders towards sinister paths.

## Training and Order

Karsten was placed in a paladin sect of [the Order of The Blessed Realm](../../World/Factions/Order-of-the-Blessed-Realm.md) known as the [Solaris Sentinals](../../World/Factions/Solaris-Sentinels.md). This secret sect consisted of highly trained, devoted, and disciplined champions dedicated to protecting the order and the community from evil forces threatening Solaris. Despite the chaos and evil surrounding him, Karsten was shielded by the prayers of his family and his unwavering faith in [Raythelion](../../World/Religion/Raythelion.md).

## Journey North

Heeding a divine command from the priests of the order, Karsten moved north to avoid [the Flaming Retribution](../../World/Events/The-Flaming-Retribution.md).

> Karsten was prophesied to be a mouthpiece for [Raythelion](../../World/Religion/Raythelion.md) before he was born. His parents devote believers in the ways of [Raythelion](../../World/Religion/Raythelion.md), believing guiding and serving the people of [Solaris](../../World/Locations/Solaris.md) was the ultimate devotion to their God, until they were asked to give their first born up to the religious leaders one night at a workshop vigil. Karsten's parents were torn by their devotion to the faith, and their love for their first son, but in the end, they trusted the prophets of [Raythelion](../../World/Religion/Raythelion.md) with their greatest treasure, their son.
A son who had been prophesied would bring back peace and restoration to the continent of [Solaris](../../World/Locations/Solaris.md) from immense devastation. The Order of [The Blessed Realm](../../World/Locations/Solaris/Old-World/The-Blessed-Realm/0-The-Blessed-Realm.md) weren't sure what these prophecies meant, but knew that this child would be a key to the solution, little did they know, they could not stop the impending doom and also went along with those whose philosophies would end up turning many devote leaders into something more sinister.
