# My expectations for the Game
1. Cameras on (I want to do a good job and it is easier to get a feel for how I am doing when I can see your faces.)
2. Let me know in the moment, if you are struggling to stay engaged.
3. Feedback on the session on a regular basis (Required to be answered before next session)
4. End of adventure check-in.
4. 5-10 Minute break every hour.
5. I know it is hard to stay focused esspecially when you have the internet avaiable to you. I will bring my A game as best I can, and I ask that you will help me out too.
