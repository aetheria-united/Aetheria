In the land of Aetheria, a great disaster has occurred. Centered on the great city of [Lumopolis](../World/Locations/Solaris/Old-World/The-Blessed-Realm/Lumopolis.md), the capital of [The Blessed Realm](../Locations/Solaris/Old-World/The-Blessed-Realm/0-The-Blessed-Realm.md), fire rained from the sky and boiling geysers erupted from the ground, causing the utter destruction of the greatest civilization Aetheria has ever known. All the advancements, both magical and technological, are in jeopardy of being lost.

A small community of [The Blessed Realm](../Locations/Solaris/Old-World/The-Blessed-Realm/0-The-Blessed-Realm.md) has escaped the devastation and is trying to pick up the pieces of their now shattered world. It is unknown whether they are the only survivors or if this destruction was localized, but they are survivors and will rediscover their world.
