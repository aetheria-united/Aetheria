# The Fall
- You have been going about your lives.
- Why did you decide to go to the Town Square?
## Strong Start
- All the sudden the ground underneath you erupts as a sink hole appears right underneath your feet.
- You fall 50 feet down nocking against rocks and ridges, Miraculusely landing unscather on a stone bridge covered in Sand and debrise.
- taking in your surroundings you see:
    - an ancient temple on one side of the bridge
    - you are surrounded by a number Dead or dieing Goblins.
    - There are scorch marks lining the walls and the ceiling of the cavern.
- Some of the Goblins you took for dead get stand up armed for battle. 
- You also notice that a what looks to be a human corpse stands up shambles towards you, while what you took for a pile of bones assembles it's self into a skeleton.
- They all Charge you. Roll initiative.
