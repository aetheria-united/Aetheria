# Idea for a quick start 
I have been trying to figure out a good way to start the campaign to get all the background data that I want with us building the world together and how to get us to be able to start playing sooner rather than later and I think I have come to a good solution and want to see if you guys are up for it.

I want to build the starting town with you using the Quiet Year. http://mikuru.ru/files/rpg/the-quiet-year/The%20Quiet%20Year%20EN.pdf If we just did that it would take a minimum of 1-2 sessions to get it done, which is far too long. So I think I will be splitting it up in the following way.

Session 1: Build characters and maybe start first adventure (depending on how long it takes us)
Session 2: Quiet year Spring (kinda like a flash back of what happened) followed by continuing playing the First Adventure
Session 3: Quiet year Summer, continue First Adventure
Session 4: Quiet year Fall, Continue First Adventure
Session 5: Quiet year Winter, continue First Adventure

I will be peppering in Back story questions and ideas through out the character making process as well, just to get more ideas of who you are. If you get inspired by anything that we create for part of the quiet year, and want to add that into your character backstory, then you are most welcome to do so.
